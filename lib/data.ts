      '# Twice-Cooked Pork\n\n## Development of the Dish\nThere are various accounts of the origins of Twice-Cooked Pork. One perspective suggests it originated in the late Qing Dynasty, but a more precise trace can be found in the Northern Song period. Initially known as "oil-exploded pork," its flavor was primarily savory and fresh. With the introduction of chili peppers during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Twice-Cooked Pork gradually took on the characteristics we know today. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the creation of broad bean paste further enhanced the taste and quality of the dish, making it one of the most famous representative dishes of Sichuan cuisine.\n\n## Legends and Stories\nIn the Ming Dynasty, Song Yi recorded the method of making "oil-exploded pork" in "Zhu Yu Fang Za Bu," which is similar to the modern method of making Twice-Cooked Pork. This indicates that the basic features of Twice-Cooked Pork had already taken shape in the Ming Dynasty. The specific record is as follows:\n> "For oil-exploded pork, take cooked pork and cut it into thin slices, then fry it in hot oil until fragrant. Add a small amount of soy sauce and wine, then add Sichuan peppercorns and green onions. It is suitable to stir-fry with shredded bamboo shoots and water bamboo shoots."\n\nThis account not only reflects the cooking techniques of the time but also shows that Twice-Cooked Pork had already occupied a place in the dietary culture of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nTwice-Cooked Pork is known for its unique taste and color, characterized by:\n- **Bright Red Color**: The addition of broad bean paste during the stir-frying process gives the dish an attractive red color.\n- **Rich but Not Greasy**: Selecting the right pork belly and cooking it until it is tender, then cooling and slicing it, results in a rich texture that is not greasy.\n- **Fragrant Flavor**: The combination of various seasonings, especially the aroma of broad bean paste and Sichuan peppercorns, makes Twice-Cooked Pork full of fragrance.\n\n## Cooking Methods\nThere are multiple ways to cook Twice-Cooked Pork, each with its unique steps and techniques. However, the basic cooking process includes:\n1. Prepare the ingredients: pork belly, garlic sprouts, green onions, ginger, garlic, dried red chili peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, broad bean paste, sugar, oil.\n2. Boil the pork belly until it is eighty percent cooked, then slice it.\n3. Heat the pan and stir-fry the chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorns with a small amount of oil.\n4. Stir-fry the pork slices until they are translucent and slightly curled at the edges.\n5. Add the broad bean paste to make a red oil, then add soy sauce or sweet bean paste for color adjustment.\n6. Finally, add the garlic sprouts, a little cooking wine, and sugar to season, then serve.\n\nIn addition to garlic sprouts, ingredients such as bell peppers, onions, chives, and "guokui" (a type of bread) can also be used to make Twice-Cooked Pork.\n\n## Nutritional Components\nThe main ingredient of Twice-Cooked Pork, pork, is rich in high-quality protein and essential fatty acids. It also contains heme and cysteine, which promote iron absorption and help prevent iron deficiency anemia. The side ingredients such as bell peppers and garlic sprouts provide a rich source of vitamins and trace elements.\n\n## Nutritional Benefits\nTwice-Cooked Pork has the effect of nourishing the kidneys and blood, moistening dryness, and is suitable for people with various body types. However, due to its high content of fat and sodium, people with high blood pressure should eat it in moderation.\n\n## Cooking Tips\nWhen cooking, pay attention to the control of heat and oil temperature to ensure the tenderness of the meat and the flavor of the dish.

## Flavor Profile of the Dish

Mapo Tofu is renowned for its distinctive flavor, which can be encapsulated by the eight-character maxim: numbing, spicy, hot, fragrant, crispy, tender, fresh, and lively.

- **Numbing**: Sichuan peppercorns are sprinkled on the tofu just before serving, with the best ones coming from Hanyuan, providing a pure numbing sensation.
- **Spicy**: The broad bean paste made from Longtan Temple's big red robe chili peppers is spicy and aromatic.
- **Hot**: The tofu maintains the dish's temperature, preventing it from cooling down quickly.
- **Fragrance**: There are no off-flavors from the tofu or seasonings, only an appetite-arousing aroma.
- **Crispy**: The minced meat is golden in color and melts in your mouth.
- **Tender**: The tofu is pan-fried and poached with a method that makes it white as jade, crumbling at a touch.
- **Fresh**: The ingredients are fresh, with both color and taste being excellent.
- **Lively**: When served, the garlic sprouts stand upright as if freshly picked, but are fully cooked upon tasting.

## Legends and Stories

### Historical Origin

- Mapo Tofu was first created in the first year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty (1862) by the proprietess of the "Chen Xingsheng Restaurant" next to the Wanfu Bridge in Chengdu, known as Old Lady Chen. Her unique cooking skills resulted in tofu that was full of color, aroma, and taste, which was highly favored.
The Wanfu Bridge of that time spanned the Fu River, and it was a common place for laborers to rest and eat. The main customers of the restaurant were oil carriers.
Chen had a unique set of cooking techniques for making tofu that was full of color, aroma, and taste, which was very popular. The braised tofu she created was called "Old Lady Chen's Mapo Tofu," and her restaurant later became known as "Old Lady Chen's Mapo Tofu Restaurant."
Books such as "Jincheng Bamboo Branch Words" and "Hibiscus Talk Old Records" have documented the history of Old Lady Chen creating Mapo Tofu.
"Jincheng Bamboo Branch Words" says: "Old Lady Chen of Mapo is still famous, the tofu is baked and the taste is the finest, the curtain shadow moves by the Wanfu Bridge, and the spring wine is sold to make the gentleman drunk." "Chengdu Overview" records that Old Lady Chen's Mapo Tofu was listed as a famous food in Chengdu at the end of the Qing Dynasty.

### Legendary Stories

- At the end of the Qing Dynasty, there was a small restaurant next to the Wanfu Bridge dock in Chengdu. The proprietess, Wen Qiaoqiao, was beautiful and fair-skinned, while her husband, Chen Chunfu, was nicknamed Chen Ma because of his pockmarked face. Thus, Wen Qiaoqiao was jokingly called Old Lady Chen. The restaurant was famous for its delicious tofu, and as a result, the dish was named "Mapo Tofu."
In the first year of the Tongzhi era (1862), Old Lady Chen welcomed a group of dock workers and porters. The dishes in the restaurant were running low, and just before closing, a group of people came and asked for a dish that was both filling, warm, and cheap. Old Lady Chen used the remaining tofu and minced beef, as well as broad bean paste and fermented black beans, to cook a tofu dish that was visually appealing, spicy, and numbing. After eating, the group praised it highly and exclaimed with satisfaction. Later, this dish gradually became the signature dish of the Chen family, attracting many people to taste it. Because this tofu was both numbing and spicy, and the proprietess was called Old Lady Chen, the dish was thus called Old Lady Chen's Mapo Tofu.

### Evolution and Variations

- Mapo Tofu is widely popular and has spread to various places, with many different cooking methods. For instance, beef was replaced with pork to accommodate diners who do not eat beef, and later it was changed back to beef, but the pork version was also widely accepted. In addition, the use of broad bean paste was increased.

### Key to Making the Dish

- Boiling tofu with salt can expel excess water, making the texture more springy and removing the bean flavor.
- Fry minced beef in a hot pan with cold oil on low heat, which is easy to stir-fry and disperse.
- Do not add Sichuan peppercorn powder too early to prevent the tofu from turning dark.
- Blanch the tofu in boiling light salted water to remove astringency and maintain a tender texture.

## Honors and Heritage

- Won the "Golden Ding Award" in 1989.
- Became a famous snack in Chengdu in 1990.
- Became a famous trademark in Sichuan in 1992.
- Became a famous dish in Bashu and China in 1999.
- Included in the "Intangible Cultural Heritage" list of Chengdu in 2010.
- Included in the "First Batch of Ten Classic Sichuan Dishes" at the World Sichuan Cuisine Conference in 2018.

The making skills of Old Lady Chen's Mapo Tofu have been passed down for seven generations and have become an intangible cultural heritage, contributing to the promotion of traditional Chinese folk food culture.

## International Development

- In 1958, Chen Jianmin introduced Mapo Tofu to Japan, where the Japanese version reduced the spiciness and numbing sensation, adding sweetness.
- With the increasing global influence of Sichuan cuisine, other countries have also started to innovate and understand Mapo Tofu in their own ways, such as "American Mapo Tofu" in the United States, "Mapo Tofu Pasta" in Italy, and "Mapo Tofu Burrito" in Mexico.`,
