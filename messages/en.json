    "twice-cooked-pork": "# Twice-Cooked Pork\n\n## Development of the Dish\nThere are various accounts of the origins of Twice-Cooked Pork. One perspective suggests it originated in the late Qing Dynasty, but a more precise trace can be found in the Northern Song period. Initially known as \"oil-exploded pork,\" its flavor was primarily savory and fresh. With the introduction of chili peppers during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Twice-Cooked Pork gradually took on the characteristics we know today. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the creation of broad bean paste further enhanced the taste and quality of the dish, making it one of the most famous representative dishes of Sichuan cuisine.\n\n## Legends and Stories\nIn the Ming Dynasty, Song Yi recorded the method of making \"oil-exploded pork\" in \"Zhu Yu Fang Za Bu,\" which is similar to the modern method of making Twice-Cooked Pork. This indicates that the basic features of Twice-Cooked Pork had already taken shape in the Ming Dynasty. The specific record is as follows:\n> \"For oil-exploded pork, take cooked pork and cut it into thin slices, then fry it in hot oil until fragrant. Add a small amount of soy sauce and wine, then add Sichuan peppercorns and green onions. It is suitable to stir-fry with shredded bamboo shoots and water bamboo shoots.\"\n\nThis account not only reflects the cooking techniques of the time but also shows that Twice-Cooked Pork had already occupied a place in the dietary culture of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nTwice-Cooked Pork is known for its unique taste and color, characterized by:\n- **Bright Red Color**: The addition of broad bean paste during the stir-frying process gives the dish an attractive red color.\n- **Rich but Not Greasy**: Selecting the right pork belly and cooking it until it is tender, then cooling and slicing it, results in a rich texture that is not greasy.\n- **Fragrant Flavor**: The combination of various seasonings, especially the aroma of broad bean paste and Sichuan peppercorns, makes Twice-Cooked Pork full of fragrance.\n\n## Cooking Methods\nThere are multiple ways to cook Twice-Cooked Pork, each with its unique steps and techniques. However, the basic cooking process includes:\n1. Prepare the ingredients: pork belly, garlic sprouts, green onions, ginger, garlic, dried red chili peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, broad bean paste, sugar, oil.\n2. Boil the pork belly until it is eighty percent cooked, then slice it.\n3. Heat the pan and stir-fry the chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorns with a small amount of oil.\n4. Stir-fry the pork slices until they are translucent and slightly curled at the edges.\n5. Add the broad bean paste to make a red oil, then add soy sauce or sweet bean paste for color adjustment.\n6. Finally, add the garlic sprouts, a little cooking wine, and sugar to season, then serve.\n\nIn addition to garlic sprouts, ingredients such as bell peppers, onions, chives, and \"guokui\" (a type of bread) can also be used to make Twice-Cooked Pork.\n\n## Nutritional Components\nThe main ingredient of Twice-Cooked Pork, pork, is rich in high-quality protein and essential fatty acids. It also contains heme and cysteine, which promote iron absorption and help prevent iron deficiency anemia. The side ingredients such as bell peppers and garlic sprouts provide a rich source of vitamins and trace elements.\n\n## Nutritional Benefits\nTwice-Cooked Pork has the effect of nourishing the kidneys and blood, moistening dryness, and is suitable for people with various body types. However, due to its high content of fat and sodium, people with high blood pressure should eat it in moderation.\n\n## Cooking Tips\nWhen cooking, pay attention to the control of heat and oil temperature to ensure the tenderness of the meat and the flavor of the dish. Also, avoid using raw oil for direct cooking to prevent affecting the taste and health of the dish.\n\n## Honors\n- In 2021, it was selected as a candidate for the Sichuan Provincial Tianfu Tourism Delicacy List.\n- In 2018, it was awarded as one of the first ten classic Sichuan dishes.\n- In 2020, it was selected as one of the 50 classic Sichuan dishes.\n- In 2021, it was rated as a provincial-level \"Tianfu Famous Dish.\"\n\nTwice-Cooked Pork is not only a classic representative of Sichuan cuisine but also an important part of Chinese food culture, loved by food enthusiasts both domestically and internationally."
